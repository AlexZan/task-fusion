# TaskFusion

TaskFusion is a task management application designed to help users manage their personal and work tasks. It is built with React and Tailwind CSS, and uses a dark theme for a modern and sleek user interface.

## Features

- Users can create an ongoing list of tasks they need to get done (ordered by priority) and another list of tasks they would like to do.
- The application includes a timer that cycles between the 'need to' and 'like to' lists, with auditory alerts when the timer starts.
- Users can mark tasks as completed, and completed tasks are displayed in a separate section.
- The application is responsive and works well on both mobile and web platforms.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/taskfusion.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd taskfusion`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

The application will start running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Plans
